Technologies Used

Frontend:
HTML: Structure of the application
CSS (with Tailwind CSS v3.4.1): Styling, animations, and responsive design
JavaScript: Core logic, DOM manipulation, and API interactions


Backend (assumed):
Node.js: For handling API requests
RESTful API: Endpoints for authentication and review management


Dependencies:
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework
PostCSS (v8.4.31) and Autoprefixer (v10.4.15): For CSS processing
Font Awesome: For star icons in ratings



Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or higher) and npm installed
A code editor (e.g., VS Code)
Git (optional, for cloning)
A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

Steps

Clone or Download the Project

Clone the repository:  git clone <repository-url>


Or download the project files as a ZIP and extract them.


Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory:  cd UserReviewHub


Install dependencies:  npm install tailwindcss@3.4.1 postcss@8.4.31 autoprefixer@10.4.15




Configure Tailwind CSS

Generate tailwind.config.js:  npx tailwindcss init


Update tailwind.config.js:  /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
    content: ['./*.html', './src/**/*.{html,js}'],
    theme: {
        extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
};


Create postcss.config.js:  module.exports = {
    plugins: {
        tailwindcss: {},
        autoprefixer: {},
    },
};




Set Up the Backend

The app uses a backend API at http://localhost:3000/api.
Ensure the backend provides endpoints like /api/auth/me, /api/products, and /api/products/{id}/review.
If the backend is unavailable, mock these endpoints or set up a Node.js server.


Prepare the Frontend Files

Ensure index.html, src/script.js, and src/styles.css are in place as per the project structure.



Running the Application

Compile the CSS

Add a build script to package.json:  "scripts": {
    "build:css": "postcss src/styles.css -o dist/styles.css"
}


Run the build:  npm run build:css




Start the Backend Server

Ensure the backend is running on http://localhost:3000.


Serve the Frontend

Use a local server:  npx live-server


Or open index.html in a browser (some features may require a server due to CORS).


Access the Application

Navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or the port provided by your server).

Known Issues

Backend Dependency: Requires a running backend server at http://localhost:3000.
Voice Feedback: May not work in some browsers (e.g., older Safari versions).
Linting Errors: Tailwind CSS directives may cause linting warnings in editors. Configure your editor to ignore unknown at-rules or use PostCSS language mode.
Performance: Loading many reviews may slow down the profile page.
